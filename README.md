# Animal Shelter Website

## Introduction

This website is for a made up animal shelter that was created by me and 3 other developers. A normal user is able to browse all of the pets in our database as well as sign up to become a volunteer for the shelter.

Once the volunteer application is submitted, both the administrator for the shelter and the new applicant will receive an appropriate email. The administrator will need to log into the website and approve any new applicants.

Once completed, the user will receive another email prompting them to log in with a temporary password and to subsequently change it. As a volunteer, the user is able to add any new pet that come up for adoption.
